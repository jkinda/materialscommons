# Overview

Materials Commons provides multiple ways to get data into the system. Data is considered the files for your project but also
the other types of data that Materials Commons tracks. For example you can upload files that contain measurements, you can
also use one of the other integrations to send your measurements into Materials Commons. These integrations can create the
samples, processes, workflows, experiments, files and other objects that make up your project.

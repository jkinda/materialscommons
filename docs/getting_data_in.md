# Overview

Materials Commons provides multiple ways to get data into the system. Data is considered the files for your project but also
the other types of data that Materials Commons tracks. For example you can upload files that contain measurements, you can
also use one of the other integrations to send your measurements into Materials Commons. These integrations can create the
samples, processes, workflows, experiments, files and other objects that make up your project.

The samples, processes, measurements and other objects are what Materials Commons uses to construct an overall view of
your project/experiment and present relationships across all your data. Constructing this by hand can be time consuming
which is why we provide different integrations and methods to automate this process as much as possible.

If you are an experimentalist who uses spreadsheets there is a reader with some simple rules that can take your spreadsheet
and construct the relationships. For computational users there are integrations to various PRISMS computational codes. Lastly
there is a Python library and corresponding command line tool. These allow you absolute control at the cost of having to
write your own integration. Over time we will be making various snippets and scripts available that you can either use as
a starting point or just run as is.

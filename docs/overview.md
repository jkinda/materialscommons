# Overview

Materials Commons is an information repository and collaboration site. It can store your files, allow you to set up projects for sharing,
make connections between the data, and help you with publishing. The site offers multiple ways of uploading files and data into the system.

# Files vs Data

Most data is stored in files. For example you might have a spreadsheet that contains samples and their measurements. The spreadsheet is
the file, while the samples and measurements are the data. In Materials Commons we provide you with ways of extracting the data
from your files so that Materials Commons can provide new ways of looking at and finding your data.

# Overview

Materials Commons provides a variety of ways to upload your files. For quick uploads of a couple of files that aren't too large
you can use the Materials Common UI to upload these. We also provide a Globus interface to reliably upload large files or
large sets of files. Lastly, if you would prefer to work from the command line the Materials Commons CLI command (mc) provides
a way to script your uploads.

Materials Commons also provides integration with PRISMS Center computational tools. If you are using one of these tools
then the files from your computational runs will be automatically uploaded to Materials Commons.

## Materials Commons UI Uploader

The Materials Commons UI provices a way for creating directories and uploading files onto the Materials Commons server.
You can access this functionality from the sidebar by clicking on the "All Files" link.

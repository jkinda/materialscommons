        <p>
            Materials Commons is a knowledge repository and virtual collaboration space for curating, archiving
            and disseminating information from experiments and computations. The site provides a collaborative
            platform that allows researchers to upload their data and results, share their data with others and
            search for information in the repository.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Materials Commons is structured to provide online access, a REST based API for researchers and
            developers
            to access and extend it, and unique URLs to results. The unique URLs provide researchers with a way to
            refer to their data and results in papers that is guaranteed to be globally unique.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Materials Commons uses a state of the art Isilon Storage Cluster. The Cluster provides data protection
            using a combination of mirroring, snapshots and redundancy. The cluster can be easily expanded to meet
            the growing needs of our community. There is currently 390TB of storage available to the Materials Commons.

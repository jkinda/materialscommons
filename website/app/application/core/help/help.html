        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Materials Commmons allows researchers to deposit, search and access data. The data can be marked as public
            or private, you can control access by group, and you can attribute the data as needed. The site provides a
            simple set of tools for uploading, searching and exploring your data. Because data sets may be large in size
            the site also provides tools for uploading and downloading data sets offline. This allows you to start a
            large upload or download and then forget about it. When the data has been successfully uploaded it will
            appear in your list of data.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating an account</h3>
        <p>
            If you don't have an account then you can only access the data sets that are marked as public. Additionally
            you cannot upload any data to Material Commons or make use of other services such as (* list of services here *).
        </p>

        <p>
            To create an account click on the "Create Account" link in the tool bar. This will open a page that will prompt
            you for your email address and a password. A notification will be sent when your account has been setup.
        </p>
        <h3>Searching for data</h3>
        <p>
            Materials Commons stores your data in a secure data center located at the University of Michigan. Once your data
            is uploaded we organize and process it. Processing doesn't change your data, instead it extracts relevant information
            from your data to make it searchable. For example, many image files have embedded in them meta data tags. These
            tags may describe the system, material, and settings used to create the image. We extract these tags, and also extract
            "interesting" text and associate it with your data set.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once this process is complete you can access your data in a number of different ways. The site provides a number
            of common searches under "My Tools" that let you view the data you have uploaded, or the data you have been granted
            access to (for example, if you are part of a lab). These searches allow you to quickly find your data and to see
            how it was arranged on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides these common searches the Search bar in the upper right allows you to type in ad-hoc searches. The search
            bar uses the extracted meta-tags, interesting text, and other relevant features for its search. It allows you to
            widen or narrow your search by features you find interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, Materials Commons provides an Explore interface for browsing through data and data sets organized by different
            classifications. The Explore interface gives you a way to look at the wide number of data available. Data items will
            often exist in more than one category, so don't worry that you might be missing something.
        </p>
        <h3>Uploading/Accessing your data</h3>
        <p>
            You can upload and access your data directly from the Materials Commons site. If you click on an individual data
            item you can choose to download it. You can also download entire data sets from the website. A data set will download
            as a zip file that you can unpack.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because many data sets and data items are large you can also choose to download your data offline. If you have installed
            the <a href="https://github.com/prisms-center/send_file">send-file (not the ultimate link)</a> client, then you can choose to have your data
            downloaded offline. Just choose the computer to send it to, and a download will be started and complete in the back ground. You
            can even logout of Materials Commons.
        </p>

        <p>
            The send-file client can also be used to upload new data and data sets to Materials Commons. For details on how to
            do this see... (put something here)

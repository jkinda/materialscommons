These configuration files allow you to run our service out of nginx. Once nginx
is installed copy these configuration files to /etc/nginx/conf.d. After you have
done that add the following entries to your 127.0.0.1 entry in /etc/hosts
mc.localhost
api.mc.localhost
mctest.localhost
api.mctest.localhost

Then start/restart nginx.

Now when you are running the web-server and mcapiservice.py you can go to
http://mc.localhost/index.html to load materialscommons. Or to connect to
the test version go go http://mctest.localhost/index.html.

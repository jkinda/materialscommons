*** Upload/Download Workflow
    There will be two methods to upload/download files from the website. If a user installs
    our send_file package they will be able to queue their requests. The advantage to using
    the send_file package is that uploads and downloads can be done in the background. The
    transfers will automatically restart if they are interrupted.

    If a user doesn't have this package installed then they can choose to upload/download
    files directly from the website. The download will take place through the browser and
    the user will have to wait while it completes.

***** Upload/Download Queue
      View the list of queued upload/download requests and their current status.

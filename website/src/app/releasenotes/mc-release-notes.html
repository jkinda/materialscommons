                    Tasks associated with a template couldn't be deleted. Now you can delete tasks with unused templates.
                    A template is unused if it doesn't have any files or samples associated with it and isn't being used
                    in a dataset.

                    Change a tasks name or notes will now also update the corresponding process name or notes.

                    Datasets can now be unpublished.

                    A simple table layout was added that shows the files associated with a process.
                </p>

                    When clicking on a task sometimes the system would think you were trying to move the
                    task to a different position, where that position is the same as the tasks current
                    position. This would cause an error. Now the condition is checked and no move attempt
                    is made if the task isn't actually being moved.
                </p>

                <md-icon md-font-icon="fa-check" class="fa fa-md-icon"></md-icon>
                <p>
                    When adding files to a process they would be saved, but wouldn't always be displayed.
                    Now files are displayed.

                    Datasets that are published had a link to view the published dataset. This was hard coded
                    to the wrong URL (actually it pointed at Google). It now points at the correct URL.
